## Scripting Examples

### Create a Simple Alarm Clock

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# alarm.sh - Start music at specific time

# Wait until 7:00 AM
while [ $(date +%H:%M) != "07:00" ]; do
    sleep 30
done

# Start playback
mpc clear
mpc add /
mpc shuffle
mpc volume 30
mpc play
```

### Random Album Playback

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# random_album.sh - Play a random album

# Get random album
ALBUM=$(mpc list album | shuf -n 1)

# Play it
mpc clear
mpc search album "$ALBUM" | mpc add
mpc play

echo "Now playing: $ALBUM"
```

### Now Playing Display

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# nowplaying.sh - Continuously display current track

watch -n 1 'mpc current -f "â™« %artist% - %title%\n   Album: %album% (%date%)"'
```

## Keyboard Shortcuts (for scripts)

You can create a script to control MPD with keyboard shortcuts:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# mpd_control.sh

case "$1" in
    play)     mpc toggle ;;
    next)     mpc next ;;
    prev)     mpc prev ;;
    stop)     mpc stop ;;
    volup)    mpc volume +5 ;;
    voldown)  mpc volume -5 ;;
    *)        echo "Usage: $0 {play|next|prev|stop|volup|voldown}" ;;
esac
```

## Troubleshooting Commands

```bash
# Check if MPD is running
systemctl status mpd

# Restart MPD service
sudo systemctl restart mpd

# Check MPD logs
sudo journalctl -u mpd -n 50

# Test connection to MPD
mpc status

# Check music directory permissions
ls -la ~/Music

# Verify audio output device
aplay -l

# Test audio playback
speaker-test -D hw:0,0 -c 2
```

## Format Specifiers

When using `-f` or `--format` with `mpc current` or `mpc playlist`:

```
%artist%      - Artist name
%album%       - Album name
%title%       - Song title
%track%       - Track number
%name%        - Stream name
%genre%       - Genre
%date%        - Release date
%composer%    - Composer
%performer%   - Performer
%comment%     - Comment
%disc%        - Disc number
%file%        - File path
%time%        - Duration (MM:SS)
%position%    - Position in playlist
```

Example:
```bash
mpc current -f "Now playing: %artist% - %title% from %album% (%date%)"
```

## Useful Aliases

Add these to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
# MPC shortcuts
alias play='mpc toggle'
alias next='mpc next'
alias prev='mpc prev'
alias stop='mpc stop'
alias volup='mpc volume +5'
alias voldown='mpc volume -5'
alias np='mpc current'
alias addall='mpc clear && mpc add / && mpc shuffle'
```

## Tips

1. **Tab Completion**: Use tab completion for file/folder names
2. **Pipe Commands**: Combine commands with pipes for powerful operations
3. **Background Playback**: MPD runs as a daemon, so music continues even if you log out
4. **Multiple Clients**: Multiple devices can control the same MPD instance
5. **Network Streaming**: Enable HTTP output in MPD to stream to other devices
